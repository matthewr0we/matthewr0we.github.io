My chosen subject for this piece was recent research carried out on krill which found the extent of the role they play in trapping carbon and subsequently maintaining the climate. <br/>

Tiny crustaceans found in the Antarctic are vital for our climate, but face fatal risks, biologists from Imperial have found. <br/>
<br/>

Euphausiacea, or as they are informally known, krill, are crustaceans that play an important role in biodiversity and population stability. But they are so much more; research carried out by Imperial has found Antarctic krill also to be responsible for a surprising amount of carbon locking; however, climate change and fishing are having a direct impact on the population. <br/>
<br/>

“Though delicious for whales, krill are also climate engineers, helping to lock carbon deeper in the ocean where it cannot return to the atmosphere so quickly.” Said Dr Anna Belcher, Ecological Biogeochemist at the British Antarctic Survey. <br/>
<br/>

Carbon locking is a result of photosynthesis, this is the process by which chlorophyll-containing plants absorb carbon dioxide from the environment and release oxygen. After that, the carbon remains trapped within the plant until it dies. Instead of photosynthesising themselves, these crustaceans eat microscopic plants known as phytoplankton. The carbon is subsequently trapped within the krill. Once their stomachs are filled, they migrate vertically down to the deep ocean, where they release the carbon through malting and faeces. <br/>
<br/>

This will stay trapped in the bottom of the ocean for at least 100 years, rendering the Southern Ocean a carbon sink capable of holding the equivalent of between 4 and 46 billion dollars of storage from their massive 20 million metric tonnes per year, which is comparable to levels within salt marshes, mangroves, and seagrass habitats. <br/>
<br/>

Other examples of carbon sinks include oil and natural gases; however, due to human consumption, these are depleting and releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Krill not only maintains aquatic populations but also prevents us from burning up any quicker than we already are. <br/>
<br/>

Despite this, it is not all good news for the krill; global warming and fishing practices are causing them to die out at a worrying rate. For fishing, they are caught for food and bait, losing their own populations and unintentionally contributing to the loss of other species. Furthermore, they face increasing polar temperatures. Water temperatures on the west Antarctic peninsula have risen by 1°C since 1955, causing a significant change for species that have evolved to specific conditions. <br/>
<br/>

Measures must be taken to conserve the earth's krill and, as a result, our atmosphere. <br/>
<br/>

“The health of the Antarctic ecosystem hinges on how much krill is available in the future.” Jen Walsh stressed after working in the Southern Ocean. <br/>
<br/>

Research found that at least 30% of global oceans must be protected from fishing practices to maintain a sustainable krill population. One example of this in the Southern Ocean is Area 48, where an annual krill catching limit of 620,000 metric tonnes per year was set. This is due to numbers reaching a 450,781 metric tonne high in 2020. <br/>
<br/>
 
Fishing has been addressed, but measures are useless if our oceans continue to heat up.

Within my science communication degree, my research interests are centred around delving into the current gap of information both in the general public and people of power regarding the spread of diseases, epidemics, and pandemics, with a focus on modern health events. I am interested in firstly finding the extent of this gap of knowledge but also figuring out how best to tackle this inequality using research and knowledge from professionals in the field. <br/>
  <br/>
I chose this research area since I have previously been taught a lot about the mathematics and systems behind how diseases spread and how to combat them in an efficient way. This was my favourite section of my bachelors, as I felt like I had truly understood why certain government measures are put in place; however, it took going to university to find out. A lot of the public and influential individuals, such as those in parliament, may be less informed, especially depending on the media they consume. For example, if someone consumes GB news, they are more likely to hold right-wing values (see Patrona. 2024), and this can have a knock-on effect on what they believe the causes and methods to deal with them are. <br/>
  <br/>
Frackowiak et. al. found that liberal views reduced discriminatory views against immigrants as well as more trust in the scientists, whereas the opposite was true for the conservative group (see Frackowiak et al. 2023). One example of this type of media was ex-American President Trump framing COVID-19 as the “Chinese virus” (see Bolsen et al. 2020). Combatting this type of misinformation may be an impossible task in the current political climate, but figuring out how to communicate efficiently should bring more clarity on how to signal the truth. <br/>
  <br/>
This has been incredibly relevant over the past few years globally with events such as COVID-19 and the health ministry’s approach to dealing with it on top of the prime minister holding parties during lockdown, all whilst he was lying to the country and parliament (see Bowman et al. 2023). <br/>
  <br/>
The main research questions that I want to understand more are as follows:
<ul>
  <li>How much would policymakers/politicians know about how to deal with another pandemic?</li>
  <li>How big is the knowledge gap between professionals and the general public? How can it be closed?</li>
  <li>What are the best methods of communicating around big health events like COVID?</li>
</ul>
 
During my dissertation, I will undertake my own primary research. I will create questionnaires and surveys for both educated and uneducated groups about the spread of diseases to highlight the main differences within knowledge levels and the forms of media they would find most helpful. I aim to talk to the professionals from my undergraduate school who specialise in the field and ask what their opinions on the education of mathematical biology and how they think this information should be spread are. I also aim to interview local politicians from a range of parties to see what they know and how much they are willing to learn and use in their campaigns. <br/>
<br/>

Outside of my own primary research, I will be mainly using academic journals, both on the scientific side of the problem and also the commentaries made on past events and actions. <br/>

Alongside my studies, I am part of my university's newspaper as one of two science & tech editors, as part of this, I edit, source and create articles once per month.

Article on the discovery of a new mersenne prime:

<details> 
  <summary> <b> Mersenne Article </b> </summary>
New prime discovery blows previous records out of the water. <br/>
<br/>

Recently, both the largest Mersenne prime and the largest prime in general was found, this is a very important discovery in the areas of mathematics and computational power. This was the 52nd Mersenne prime ever found and between the previous discovery and this one, it took mathematicians 7 years using specialist software to do so. <br/>
<br/>

A Mersenne prime is a prime number of the form 2p - 1 where p is a pre-existing prime number. To start with, these numbers are small, the first three being 3, 7 and 31 but very quickly ramps up, with the 10th Mersenne already reaching 27 digits. In 1995, in aide of finding these huge numbers, the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS) was set up to corroborate efforts by several mathematicians as well as releasing free software for the sole purpose of finding Mersennes. <br/>
<br/>

Luke Durant, an ex-NVIDIA employee turned researcher was the person responsible for the discovery, he did this by creating a “cloud supercomputer” of GPUs all simultaneously using the GIMPS software. This resulted in the discovery of a number 16 million digits larger than the 51st Mersenne prime, a 41 million digit number I can’t even begin to type out. But in the form mentioned earlier, this is written as 2136,279,841 - 1. <br/>
<br/>

New prime numbers are a very relevant concept with applications within mathematics and computer science. After the searching process, these numbers need to be checked since the  calculations have many stages where it can go wrong, for example, 274,207,281 - 1 took roughly 34 quadrillion steps. Checking these primes helps consolidate otherwise hard to verify algorithms. This algorithm checking helps train GPUs to become more efficient. <br/>
<br/>

In mathematics, and specifically number theory, prime numbers are and have always been an area of great interest. Mersenne primes have a particular link to perfect numbers, these are numbers where the number itself is equal to the sum of all its divisors. This tell us that if 2p - 1 is a prime, then 2p - 1(2p - 1) is a perfect number. <br/>
<br/>

Luke received $3000 for this discovery, but is using this to donate towards the Alabama School of Math and Science, so clearly did it out of passion for the field. <br/>
