<b> Assignment 1 - Short news story (<500 words) </b> <br/>

My chosen subject for this piece was recent research carried out on krill which found the extent of the role they play in trapping carbon and subsequently maintaining the climate. <br/>

Tiny crustaceans found in the Antarctic are vital for our climate, but face fatal risks, biologists from Imperial have found. <br/>
<br/>

Euphausiacea, or as they are informally known, krill, are crustaceans that play an important role in biodiversity and population stability. But they are so much more; research carried out by Imperial has found Antarctic krill also to be responsible for a surprising amount of carbon locking; however, climate change and fishing are having a direct impact on the population. <br/>
<br/>

“Though delicious for whales, krill are also climate engineers, helping to lock carbon deeper in the ocean where it cannot return to the atmosphere so quickly.” Said Dr Anna Belcher, Ecological Biogeochemist at the British Antarctic Survey. <br/>
<br/>

Carbon locking is a result of photosynthesis, this is the process by which chlorophyll-containing plants absorb carbon dioxide from the environment and release oxygen. After that, the carbon remains trapped within the plant until it dies. Instead of photosynthesising themselves, these crustaceans eat microscopic plants known as phytoplankton. The carbon is subsequently trapped within the krill. Once their stomachs are filled, they migrate vertically down to the deep ocean, where they release the carbon through malting and faeces. <br/>
<br/>

This will stay trapped in the bottom of the ocean for at least 100 years, rendering the Southern Ocean a carbon sink capable of holding the equivalent of between 4 and 46 billion dollars of storage from their massive 20 million metric tonnes per year, which is comparable to levels within salt marshes, mangroves, and seagrass habitats. <br/>
<br/>

Other examples of carbon sinks include oil and natural gases; however, due to human consumption, these are depleting and releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Krill not only maintains aquatic populations but also prevents us from burning up any quicker than we already are. <br/>
<br/>

Despite this, it is not all good news for the krill; global warming and fishing practices are causing them to die out at a worrying rate. For fishing, they are caught for food and bait, losing their own populations and unintentionally contributing to the loss of other species. Furthermore, they face increasing polar temperatures. Water temperatures on the west Antarctic peninsula have risen by 1°C since 1955, causing a significant change for species that have evolved to specific conditions. <br/>
<br/>

Measures must be taken to conserve the earth's krill and, as a result, our atmosphere. <br/>
<br/>

“The health of the Antarctic ecosystem hinges on how much krill is available in the future.” Jen Walsh stressed after working in the Southern Ocean. <br/>
<br/>

Research found that at least 30% of global oceans must be protected from fishing practices to maintain a sustainable krill population. One example of this in the Southern Ocean is Area 48, where an annual krill catching limit of 620,000 metric tonnes per year was set. This is due to numbers reaching a 450,781 metric tonne high in 2020. <br/>
<br/>
 
Fishing has been addressed, but measures are useless if our oceans continue to heat up.
