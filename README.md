<b>Short news story (<500 words) </b> <br/>

My chosen subject for this piece was recent research carried out on krill which found the extent of the role they play in trapping carbon and subsequently maintaining the climate. <br/>

Tiny crustaceans found in the Antarctic are vital for our climate, but face fatal risks, biologists from Imperial have found. <br/>
<br/>

Euphausiacea, or as they are informally known, krill, are crustaceans that play an important role in biodiversity and population stability. But they are so much more; research carried out by Imperial has found Antarctic krill also to be responsible for a surprising amount of carbon locking; however, climate change and fishing are having a direct impact on the population. <br/>
<br/>

“Though delicious for whales, krill are also climate engineers, helping to lock carbon deeper in the ocean where it cannot return to the atmosphere so quickly.” Said Dr Anna Belcher, Ecological Biogeochemist at the British Antarctic Survey. <br/>
<br/>

Carbon locking is a result of photosynthesis, this is the process by which chlorophyll-containing plants absorb carbon dioxide from the environment and release oxygen. After that, the carbon remains trapped within the plant until it dies. Instead of photosynthesising themselves, these crustaceans eat microscopic plants known as phytoplankton. The carbon is subsequently trapped within the krill. Once their stomachs are filled, they migrate vertically down to the deep ocean, where they release the carbon through malting and faeces. <br/>
<br/>

This will stay trapped in the bottom of the ocean for at least 100 years, rendering the Southern Ocean a carbon sink capable of holding the equivalent of between 4 and 46 billion dollars of storage from their massive 20 million metric tonnes per year, which is comparable to levels within salt marshes, mangroves, and seagrass habitats. <br/>
<br/>

Other examples of carbon sinks include oil and natural gases; however, due to human consumption, these are depleting and releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Krill not only maintains aquatic populations but also prevents us from burning up any quicker than we already are. <br/>
<br/>

Despite this, it is not all good news for the krill; global warming and fishing practices are causing them to die out at a worrying rate. For fishing, they are caught for food and bait, losing their own populations and unintentionally contributing to the loss of other species. Furthermore, they face increasing polar temperatures. Water temperatures on the west Antarctic peninsula have risen by 1°C since 1955, causing a significant change for species that have evolved to specific conditions. <br/>
<br/>

Measures must be taken to conserve the earth's krill and, as a result, our atmosphere. <br/>
<br/>

“The health of the Antarctic ecosystem hinges on how much krill is available in the future.” Jen Walsh stressed after working in the Southern Ocean. <br/>
<br/>

Research found that at least 30% of global oceans must be protected from fishing practices to maintain a sustainable krill population. One example of this in the Southern Ocean is Area 48, where an annual krill catching limit of 620,000 metric tonnes per year was set. This is due to numbers reaching a 450,781 metric tonne high in 2020. <br/>
<br/>
 
Fishing has been addressed, but measures are useless if our oceans continue to heat up.

Within my science communication degree, my research interests are centred around delving into the current gap of information both in the general public and people of power regarding the spread of diseases, epidemics, and pandemics, with a focus on modern health events. I am interested in firstly finding the extent of this gap of knowledge but also figuring out how best to tackle this inequality using research and knowledge from professionals in the field. <br/>
  <br/>
I chose this research area since I have previously been taught a lot about the mathematics and systems behind how diseases spread and how to combat them in an efficient way. This was my favourite section of my bachelors, as I felt like I had truly understood why certain government measures are put in place; however, it took going to university to find out. A lot of the public and influential individuals, such as those in parliament, may be less informed, especially depending on the media they consume. For example, if someone consumes GB news, they are more likely to hold right-wing values (see Patrona. 2024), and this can have a knock-on effect on what they believe the causes and methods to deal with them are. <br/>
  <br/>
Frackowiak et. al. found that liberal views reduced discriminatory views against immigrants as well as more trust in the scientists, whereas the opposite was true for the conservative group (see Frackowiak et al. 2023). One example of this type of media was ex-American President Trump framing COVID-19 as the “Chinese virus” (see Bolsen et al. 2020). Combatting this type of misinformation may be an impossible task in the current political climate, but figuring out how to communicate efficiently should bring more clarity on how to signal the truth. <br/>
  <br/>
This has been incredibly relevant over the past few years globally with events such as COVID-19 and the health ministry’s approach to dealing with it on top of the prime minister holding parties during lockdown, all whilst he was lying to the country and parliament (see Bowman et al. 2023). <br/>
  <br/>
The main research questions that I want to understand more are as follows:
<ul>
  <li>How much would policymakers/politicians know about how to deal with another pandemic?</li>
  <li>How big is the knowledge gap between professionals and the general public? How can it be closed?</li>
  <li>What are the best methods of communicating around big health events like COVID?</li>
</ul>
 
During my dissertation, I will undertake my own primary research. I will create questionnaires and surveys for both educated and uneducated groups about the spread of diseases to highlight the main differences within knowledge levels and the forms of media they would find most helpful. I aim to talk to the professionals from my undergraduate school who specialise in the field and ask what their opinions on the education of mathematical biology and how they think this information should be spread are. I also aim to interview local politicians from a range of parties to see what they know and how much they are willing to learn and use in their campaigns. <br/>
<br/>

Outside of my own primary research, I will be mainly using academic journals, both on the scientific side of the problem and also the commentaries made on past events and actions. <br/>

### Forge Press (Science & Tech Editor Role)

Alongside my studies, I am part of my university's newspaper as one of two science & tech editors, as part of this, I edit, source and create articles once per month.

#### <b>Original Articles</b>

Article on the discovery of a new mersenne prime:

<details> 
  <summary> <b> Mersenne Article </b> </summary>
New prime discovery blows previous records out of the water. <br/>
<br/>

Recently, both the largest Mersenne prime and the largest prime in general was found, this is a very important discovery in the areas of mathematics and computational power. This was the 52<sup>nd</sup> Mersenne prime ever found and between the previous discovery and this one, it took mathematicians 7 years using specialist software to do so. <br/>
<br/>

A Mersenne prime is a prime number of the form 2<sup>p</sup> - 1 where p is a pre-existing prime number. To start with, these numbers are small, the first three being 3, 7 and 31 but very quickly ramps up, with the 10<sup>th</sup> Mersenne already reaching 27 digits. In 1995, in aide of finding these huge numbers, the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS) was set up to corroborate efforts by several mathematicians as well as releasing free software for the sole purpose of finding Mersennes. <br/>
<br/>

Luke Durant, an ex-NVIDIA employee turned researcher was the person responsible for the discovery, he did this by creating a “cloud supercomputer” of GPUs all simultaneously using the GIMPS software. This resulted in the discovery of a number 16 million digits larger than the 51st Mersenne prime, a 41 million digit number I can’t even begin to type out. But in the form mentioned earlier, this is written as 2<sup>136,279,841</sup> - 1. <br/>
<br/>

New prime numbers are a very relevant concept with applications within mathematics and computer science. After the searching process, these numbers need to be checked since the  calculations have many stages where it can go wrong, for example, 2<sup>74,207,281</sup> - 1 took roughly 34 quadrillion steps. Checking these primes helps consolidate otherwise hard to verify algorithms. This algorithm checking helps train GPUs to become more efficient. <br/>
<br/>

In mathematics, and specifically number theory, prime numbers are and have always been an area of great interest. Mersenne primes have a particular link to perfect numbers, these are numbers where the number itself is equal to the sum of all its divisors. This tell us that if 2<sup>p</sup> - 1 is a prime, then 2<sup>p - 1</sup>(2<sup>p</sup> - 1) is a perfect number. <br/>
<br/>

Luke received $3000 for this discovery, but is using this to donate towards the Alabama School of Math and Science, so clearly did it out of passion for the field. <br/>

Article on what my university's researchers are up to:

<details> 
  <summary> <b> What are our researchers up to? </b> </summary>
What are our researchers up to? A university-wide view at Sheffield's recent work <br/>
<br/>

All over university, the lecturers we know and see every week, are all highly accomplished academics, with a plethora of research topics and papers between them. In recent months there have been some incredible advancements spearheaded by both the researchers at this uni and their research teams. These range from conservation efforts within turtle populations to developments in 6G networks. This article will explore several of these.<br/>
<br/>

<b>Biologists find new information about turtle fertility.</b> <br/>
<br/>

In first-of-its-kind research, scientists from Sheffield University have developed techniques to help understand the fertility rates within turtles and tortoises. To do this, the team, led by PhD student Alessia Lavigne, used microscopic techniques, mainly developed for bird eggs to freeze and subsequently analyse their states.<br/>
<br/>

These experiments led to the discovery that 75% of undeveloped eggs that had been viewed were fertilised, however contained embryos that died at an early stage. This was mainly true for wild sea turtles, whereas with giant turtles, it was found that their problems lie in the fertilisation rate.<br/>
<br/>

This research has helped conservation teams differ their focus for various species, for example, protecting wild turtle's embryonic growth via looking after nests.<br/>
<br/>

<b>Bioscientists uncover the MRSA mechanism responsible for its antibiotic resistance.</b><br/>
<br/>

MRSA is one of the most prolific bacteria and is typically harmless outside the body. But when it gets in, it causes more than 120,000 deaths per year. This bacteria is infamous for its antibiotic resistance, being resistant to the entire group of beta-lactams.<br/>
<br/>

Previous work found that this was due to a new cell wall enzyme tailored to survive antibiotic exposure, but this isn’t everything. The multidisciplinary team of Bioscience’s Dr Simon Foster and Physics’ Dr Jamie Hobbs found that MRSA has evolved to have a division mechanism, allowing the bacteria to grow, split, and spread.<br/>
<br/>

This research has huge potential to help us develop more effective antibiotics and hopefully lower the risk of MRSA.<br/>
<br/>

<b>Engineering professor set to drive the push for 6G networks.</b><br/>
<br/>

After being awarded a prestigious research chair from the Royal Academy of Engineering, Professor Timothy O’Farrell FREng will work with Keysight Technologies with the goal of developing new waveforms for transmitting signals.<br/>
<br/>

Instead of the single waveforms used in earlier networks including 4G and 5G, 6G presents the problem of finding a method using multiple waveforms simultaneously since single waveforms aren’t an option. This is especially promising after the university opened the UKs first 6G radio systems facility.<br/>
<br/>

As O’Farrell stated, “6G will be an important technology in people’s lives beyond 2030.”<br/>

### Other Journalism

Most of my other journalism has been on my friends music site, <a href="url"> https://undertonereviews.wordpress.com/ </a>. One example of my work on there is an article on the current state of indie music.

<details> 
  <summary> <b> Music Article </b> </summary>
<b> Britain’s new age indie scene – a new sound is on the rise and you don’t want to miss out </b><br/>
  <br/>
A new wave of indie music has been brewing and the potential isn’t barred by any limits. Indie music has been huge in the UK for as long as I remember, but new factors are changing the sound of the new up-and-coming talent into something completely different. By Matthew Rowe. <br/>
<br/>

Indie music has often been praised as the voice of the younger generation, and you will often find that the youth will associate themselves with the sound of the ever-recognisable tunes of the Arctic Monkeys, the Strokes, and Pulp, just to name a few. These are big household names who have helped develop and create their own indie sound, one that will certainly never be forgotten. However, more recently, there has been a huge burst of creativity within the indie scene, with a lot of new talent alongside it. These new artists are helping preserve the meaning of indie while putting their own twist on it.<br/>
<br/>

As a genre, indie music has a massive cultural significance that can’t be ignored. For one, the university experience I’ve enjoyed wouldn’t have been anywhere as good without it. You can’t go to a party without soaking up indie music and its culture. My personal favourite venue, The Leadmill, is host to many indie nights out and so many great gigs; it is truly a hub of musical exploration and a place to have a damn good time (bless the £1.50 doubles). <br/>
<br/>

The sound may be developing but some things in indie don’t change. Themes in indie songs still follow consistent themes and messages. If I had a pound for every reference to how bad the Tories are in an indie song, I’d be deemed a Conservative voter. But this is what it’s all about: the voice of the youth expressing their opinions on a vast amount of issues both inside the UK and globally, one example being Declan McKenna‘s British Bombs, a modern-day cult classic that is recognisable instantaneously. The standard themes are being followed but some have rightfully been pushed further than others. Ideas of identity, self-worth and female empowerment have been made so much more vocal, creating an insight into issues recently pushed into the public’s eye, often to the distaste of the older generation. Two songs that I think show this beautifully are Lime Garden’s I Want To Be You and CMAT’s Whatever’s Inconvenient. The sounds of the greats don’t lose their value and are often replicated by bands wanting to reach the great hits their predecessors had. This is shown by Sheffield-based band The Reytons, who have adapted local legends and the Arctic Monkeys sound relatively successfully. If you are ever on a night out, it’s unexplainable, but the atmosphere will become electric whenever an indie banger comes on. <br/>
<br/>

These developments can’t purely be put down to indie music; the music scene as a whole has shifted in recent years. Huge developments in UK jazz, post-punk and rap have all had their impact on the genre, elevating it to a whole new level. This allows a level of creativity and it shows. Post-punk has had such an amazing impact; artists such as BC,NR have had such a huge impact, and other bands in the crank wave subgenre are interchangeable with indie. Hard-hitting indie bands Do Nothing, Dry Cleaning, and Courting are great examples of the development of indie in the post-punk direction. This isn’t the only way the scene has developed; spoken word has snuck its way in almost seamlessly. Leeds band Yard Act are a great example of this, often leaving the preconceptions of how an indie song should be laid out, allowing them to both create standard songs with funky hooks but also much more solemn monologues. This sound is also shown by the much more popular Wet Leg. <br/>
<br/>

Outside of the UK, very unexpected artists have been entering the domain. Rapper Lil Yachty gained a reputation for creating rap songs such as iSpy, but last year he took a huge risk by entering alternative indie with the very influential album Let’s Start Here. This was a complete change in vibe for the American artist but it paid off. The song Drive Me Crazy! is a perfect example of this new experimental feel he was going for, creating a perfect example of how the genre of rap has been infused into indie. The concept has been around for a while. Years ago, Arctic Monkeys collaborated with British icon Dizzie Rascal to create Temptation Greets You Like Your Naughty Friend. Bloc Party is known for mixing the two consistently, but it’s incredibly promising to see otherwise unexpected artists entering the subgenre. <br/>
<br/>

Here are some songs by the insane new talent that you need to hear:<br/>
<br/>
 <ul>
<li>I Want To Be You – Lime Garden (Single)</li>
 </ul> <br/>
This song is a perfect embodiment of how the standards held by those famous on TV lead to innate jealousy and a desire to change their body and lifestyle, highlighting the huge issues of being surrounded by these fake idols. This is consistent in Lime Garden’s music, a girl band who seamlessly expresses modern issues in their songs <br/>
<br/>

 <ul>
<li>Nearly Daffodils – English Teacher (Nearly Daffodils)</li>
 </ul> <br/>

Heavily post-punk inspired band English Teacher often takes a heavier, rock feel to indie, especially in this song sounding akin to a hybrid of Fontaines D.C., Dry Cleaning, and Wet Leg. The singer, ironically named Lily Fontaine, bridges the gap between a harsh, brutal instrumental and a much more melodic and soothing voice, despite still being able to shout out to drive home the whole point: “You can lead water to the daffodils, but you can’t make them drink.” Fontaine’s range is shown in their discography, with much more melancholy compositions like Mastermind Specialism and a poetic start to Yorkshire Tapas.<br/>
<br/>

 <ul>
<li>R Entertainment – Sports Team (Gulp!)</li>
 </ul> <br/>

It wouldn’t be a list of indie recommendations if I didn’t mention Cambridge-formed band Sports Team, who gained notoriety in 2020 with their debut album Deep Down Happy and many of my favourite indie rock songs, such as Stations of the Cross. They haven’t slowed down since, going on several tours or releasing a second album, Gulp!. This album hasn’t gained as much traction as their debut, but in my opinion it has songs of the same or even better quality. R Entertainment is my pick from this album, a commentary on how desensitised the general public has become to otherwise shocking content and how war, homicide, and car crashes have become almost trivial to us. “They’re mowing us down, for R entertainment.” The slang just emphasises how much of an issue it is in the UK.<br/>
<br/>

 <ul>
<li>I Wanna Be a Cowboy, Baby! – CMAT (If My Wife New I’d Be Dead)</li>
 </ul><br/>

CMAT has one of the most impressive voices I have ever heard. Hailing from Ireland, she doesn’t hold back with her loud, passion-filled choruses. I had the pleasure of seeing her live recently, and I was amazed her voice hadn’t died by the end of a nearly three hour action packed and downright fun set. Her song I Wanna Be a Cowboy, Baby! covers so many issues while being an incredibly catchy banger. Several people in the crowd donned cowboy hats for the gig. Issues of self-identity and empowerment are covered here with lines such as “But I break down every time I’m on the scales” and “My style icon is the wolverine / Between each finger lies the key / To getting home without a buckaroo.” These lines emphasise issues of body standards as well as how society and men will often go out with the pure intention of going home with someone and view women as objects, the keys referencing needing self-defense on a day-to-day basis. Her discography covers so many deep issues while maintaining high quality and listenability.<br/>
<br/>

The British music scene and indie as a whole are in great hands; these new talents have already achieved brilliant things, from widely acclaimed albums to supporting huge global talents to having their own national and international tours. I can’t wait to see what they are capable of and how other genres will continue to influence both new and established artists. The Arctic Monkeys delving into more lounge and art rock is a great example of this. To conclude, please give the new indie scene a listen, specifically the songs mentioned above. <br/>
